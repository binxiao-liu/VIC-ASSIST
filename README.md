# VIC-ASSIST
Variable Infiltration Capacity Automated Setup Toolkit

The Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC; Liang et al., 1994) hydrologic and river routing model simulates the water and energy fluxes that occur near the land surface and provides useful information regarding the quantity and timing of available water within a watershed system. VIC-Automated Setup Toolkit (VIC-ASSIST) is a user-friendly software package, accessible through an intuitive MATLAB graphical user interface. VIC-ASSIST enables users to navigate the model building process through prompts and automation, with the intention to promote the use of the model for practical, educational, and research purposes. The automated processes include watershed delineation, climate and geographical input set-up, model parameter calibration, sensitivity analysis, and graphical output generation.
